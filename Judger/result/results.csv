450,What is a global minimum in machine learning?,A global minimum is the point in the loss landscape where the loss function reaches its lowest value.,The global minimum is the optimal solution where the model achieves the best performance.,0.8826809,0.8911,machine
451,What is a saddle point?,A saddle point is a point in the loss landscape where the gradient is zero but is neither a minimum nor a maximum.,A saddle point is a flat region in the loss landscape that can slow down training.,0.88418275,0.90608746,machine
452,What is a learning rate schedule?,A learning rate schedule is a plan for adjusting the learning rate during training to improve convergence.,A learning rate schedule dynamically changes the learning rate to optimize training performance.,0.91934806,0.90281427,human
453,What is a warm-up in training?,A warm-up is a technique where the learning rate is gradually increased at the start of training to stabilize learning.,Warm-up phases help models start training smoothly by slowly increasing the learning rate.,0.901144,0.8548625,human
454,What is a plateau in training?,A plateau is a phase during training where the model's performance stops improving despite continued training.,"A plateau occurs when the loss function stops decreasing, indicating a need for adjustments.",0.9274394,0.883437,human
455,What is a batch size?,Batch size is the number of training examples used in one forward and backward pass during training.,Batch size determines how many samples are processed before updating the model's parameters.,0.89841205,0.864669,human
456,What is stochastic gradient descent (SGD)?,SGD is an optimization algorithm that updates model parameters using the gradient of the loss function for a single training example.,"SGD updates parameters using one sample at a time, making it noisy but computationally efficient.",0.90442127,0.83601946,human
457,What is mini-batch gradient descent?,Mini-batch gradient descent is a variant of SGD where updates are made using a small subset of the training data.,Mini-batch gradient descent balances the efficiency of SGD and the stability of batch gradient descent.,0.92569065,0.8983666,human
458,What is Adam optimization?,Adam is an adaptive optimization algorithm that combines the benefits of momentum and RMSProp for efficient training.,"Adam adjusts learning rates for each parameter, making it effective for a wide range of problems.",0.9061696,0.88999975,human
459,What is RMSProp?,RMSProp is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the magnitude of recent gradients.,RMSProp uses a moving average of squared gradients to normalize the learning rate.,0.8951694,0.8743355,human
460,What is momentum in optimization?,Momentum is a technique that accelerates gradient descent by adding a fraction of the previous update to the current update.,Momentum helps optimization algorithms overcome local minima and saddle points.,0.88273674,0.89777446,machine
